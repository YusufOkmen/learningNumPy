When we want to access a data from different perspectives we use dimensions. For examle: 

1 Dimension = Let's think that we have multiple scores of ONE student

studentArr = np.array([40, 59, 30]) # first test=40, seconde test=59, third test=30

now let's take this example to 2 Dimension

studentArr = np.array([[40, 59, 30], [40, 23, 80]]) # Now we have three test scores of TWO different students

finally 3 Dimension

studentArr = np.array([
    [[30, 40, 50], [50, 50, 40]], # test scores of two students in class 1
    [[50, 32, 45], [30, 40, 20]] # test scores of two student in class 2
    ])


For this example
Axis 0 = Classes
Axis 1 = Students
Axis 2 = Tests
